- **Recognize Stance Entries:** Watch for Feng transitioning into Kenpo (KNP), Swaying Willow (STC), or other stances to prepare your defense.
- **Punish Unsafe Moves:** Know your character's punishes for Feng's moves that are -13 or worse on block.
- **Use High-Crushing Moves:** Against high attacks like STC 2, STC 3, and SS 2.
- **Block Low and Punish:** Be prepared to block low attacks like KNP 1, KNP 4, BT d+1, BT d+3, STC 4, and SS 4; punish accordingly.
- **Maintain Optimal Range:** Keep Feng at a distance to limit his stance options and mix-ups.
- **Be Wary of Frame Advantage:** Feng has several moves that leave him at advantage on block; be cautious when pressing buttons afterward.
- **Sidestep:** Sidestep Right can be effective against some of Feng's linear attacks.
