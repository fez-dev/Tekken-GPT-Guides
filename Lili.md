## **General Counter Strategies**

- **Recognize Stance Entries:** Watch for Lili transitioning into **Back Turned (BT)** or **Dèjà Vu (DEW)** stances to anticipate her options.
- **Punish Unsafe Moves:** Use appropriate frame punishes against Lili's moves that are **-11 or worse on block**.
- **Block Low and Punish:** Be prepared to block and punish low attacks like **BT d+2**, **BT d+3**, **BT d+3+4**, **BT d+4**, and **b+3,3**.
- **Use Quick Punishes:** Many of Lili's unsafe moves can be punished with **i11~i13** frame moves.
- **Be Wary of Mix-ups:** Lili has strong mix-up potential with her mid and low attacks; vary your defense to avoid being predictable.
- **Maintain Optimal Range:** Keep distance to limit Lili's pressure and minimize her mix-up opportunities.
- **Sidestep Left:** Sidestepping left can be effective against some of Lili's linear attacks.
- **Be Cautious of Frame Advantage:** After certain moves like **BT 3+4**, **DEW 3+4**, and **H f,F+3+4**, Lili has frame advantage; avoid pressing buttons immediately after blocking these moves.
