- **Use High-Crushing Moves:** Utilize moves that go under high attacks to counter moves like **CAT 2**, **CAT 3**, **HRS 1**, and **SS 4**.
- **Be Wary of Charged Moves:** Lidia can charge certain moves to increase frame advantage; be cautious and maintain defense.
- **Maintain Optimal Range:** Keep distance to limit Lidia's pressure and minimize her mix-up opportunities.
- **Sidestep:** Sidestep to evade linear attacks; adjust based on Lidia's tracking moves.
- **Be Cautious of Frame Advantage:** After certain moves like **HRS 4**, **WLF 1**, and **H.1+2** (charged versions), Lidia has frame advantage; avoid pressing buttons immediately after blocking these moves.
